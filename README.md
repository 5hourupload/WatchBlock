# WatchBlock

WatchBlock is Watermelon's take on personal security.  Our app allows its users to feel safe by providing them with information on criminal activity around their area.  WatchBlock is your neighborhood watch app away from your neighborhood.  Using blockchain technology provided by Devvio, WatchBlock stores crime data on the blockchain so that it is immutable, and safe for everyone to access.  WatchBlock will send its users live notifications for new crime reports based on their current location.  Users can set a crime radius which specifies an area within their location they want to receive crime updates for.  They can also set a crime time window, which allows users to specify how recent the crimes must be in order to receive a notification about them.  It has never been so easy to feel safe in your environment.
