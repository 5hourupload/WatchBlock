# WatchBlock

### Description:

WatchBlock is our take on personal security.  Our app allows its users to feel safe by providing them with information on criminal activity around their area.  WatchBlock is your neighborhood watch app away from your neighborhood.  Using blockchain technology provided by Devvio, WatchBlock stores crime data on the blockchain so that it is immutable, and safe for everyone to access.  WatchBlock will send its users live notifications for new crime reports based on their current location.  Users can set a crime radius which specifies an area within their location they want to receive crime updates for. They can also set a crime time window, which allows users to specify how recent the crimes must be in order to receive a notification about them. 

Users are directed to the official Albuquerque police reporting website to notify the polic after reporting a crime. All reported crimes are immediately sent to everyone with the app, so any crime notifications users receive will be current and relevant to there safety. Other crime watch apps do not have this advantage as all crime reports must go through the olice first. It has never been so easy to feel safe in your environment.
